# Swedish-Style Crossword Generator
Swedish-style crosswords are quite different from English (and many other 
languages) crosswords in that they are much more dense, with almost every
square being taken up by a letter, and nearly every letter being shared between
multiple words. This makes designing a Swedish style crossword massively more 
difficult. This generator aims to help in that process.

## Instructions
To be added, as this codebase reaches some amount of maturity... But for now:

Wordlists are stored in text files ending in `.words`. Each line is one word. 
Optionally, you can include the hints as well, if separated by a `:` character. 

Example file: 
```
horse
shoe:on your foot
roof:on the house
sheep
cat
```
